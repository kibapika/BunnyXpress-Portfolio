        <h1>Meet The Artist - Eva</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Eva (BunnyXpress) and I am a new artist based in New
          York! I have always had a passion for drawing, and decided to showcase
          my art with inspiration from my childhood~
          <br />
          I grew up watching anime, drinking vita lemon tea, and playing Pok√©mon
          Sapphire on my Gameboy Advance. These are just some of the few things
          that inspired my art.
          <br />
          In the summer of 2023 I decided to take a leap of faith and open my
          very first Etsy shop! I hope the little joys from my life can also
          brighten a little bit of your day~
